        <h2>What are rice balls?</h2>
        <p>
          Japanese rice balls (Onigiri) are a staple of Japanese lunch boxes.
          They are usually shaped into rounds or triangles by hand and are a fun
          treat to make and eat!
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually wrapped in nori (dried seaweed) or rolled in sesame seeds,
          consider shichimi togarashi as a topping. This is a Japanese spice
          blend made up of ground sesame seeds, orange peel, and chile pepper.
