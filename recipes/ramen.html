        <h2>What are ramen noodles?</h2>
        <p>
          Ramen is a Japanese noodle dish with as many variations as there are
          regions in Japan. It's basically a noodle soup, most often made with a
          meat or chicken broth, and occasionally a fish-based broth. Making
          delicious ramen noodles can be quite difficult. Chefs in Japan usually
          train very hard to make quality ramen.
